# flaskapp
flask app that uses api key to retrieve user request data for news articles around the world. 
the home page has general news articles displaying from the api news server. 
users are able to submit a search request on any topic they are interested in and will recieve news articles from sources all around the world that mention the requested subject. 
Users can click on any of the articles to be redirected to the actual article in a new browser tab. 
I have built a dockerimage from the constructed dockerfile for my project. The project runs successfully from the container port.
i will be deploying this through Azure Kubernetes services
